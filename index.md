# Pro Tips
## Enable split-screen mode for more apps!
Some apps don't support split-screen mode. But here is a work-around that works for most of these apps:

1. [enable your phone's developer settings](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) if you haven't already.
2. enable the **Settings** > **System** > **Developer options** > **Force activities to be re-sizable** option.
3. restart your phone.
4. DONE! Now you should be able to trigger split-screen mode on tons more apps.

Unfortunately, some apps like Instagram will crash if you try to put it into split-screen mode.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why isn't Split screen working on the home screen?
Split screen can only be toggled on when there is an app other than the home screen app opened. (e.g. YouTube)

## Why am I getting **"App doesn't support split screen"** message?
See (Enable split-screen mode for more apps)[https://ericytsang.github.io/app.android.multiwindow/index.html#enable-split-screen-mode-for-more-apps]

## Why is split-screen mode turning on then off right away?
Your phone may already come with the split-screen shortcut. Go into the Split Screen app's settings, and turn off the tigger that's causing this issue. Alternatively, uninstall our Split Screen app.
