# Pro Tips
## <a name="enable-split-screen-mode-for-more-apps"></a>Enable force split-screen
Some apps like [Facebook Messenger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.orca), [LINE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.naver.line.android), and [Google Duo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tachyon) don't support split-screen mode. To force them to allow split-screen mode:

1. [enable _developer settings_ on the phone](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) if it isn't already.
2. open Android's **Settings** app.
3. enable the **System** > **Developer options** > **Force activities to be re-sizable** option. (it should be at the very bottom...)
5. restart the phone.
6. done! split-screen mode should work on tons more apps now.

Unfortunately, some apps like [Instagram](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android) may crash if put into split-screen mode. And other apps like the homescreen, and [Google Assistant](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.googleassistant) still disallow split-screen mode.

## Change long press duration
To change the long press duration:

1. open Android's **Settings** app.
2. go to: **Accessibility** > **Touch & hold delay**.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why isn't Split screen working on the home screen?
An app must be open before split-screen mode can be activated. (e.g. YouTube)

## Why am I getting _"App does not support split screen"_ message?
See [Enable force split-screen](#enable-split-screen-mode-for-more-apps).

## Why is split-screen mode turning on then off right away?
Some phones already come with a split-screen shortcut; this app, and the system shortcut could be interfering with each other. Go into the Split Screen app's settings, and turn off the trigger that's causing this issue. Alternatively, uninstall the Split Screen app.

## Why does the accessibility service keep turning off by itself?
This happens because of overly aggressigve *"battery optimization"*. Split Screen has no control over this. On most devices, you can disable app optimization for Split Screen in Android's Settings to stop it from disabling the accessibility service. This is usually found in `Settings > Battery`, and sometimes in `Apps & Notifications > Special app access > Battery optimization`.

## How do I use my home button to toggle split screen mode?
## Why does it act so buggy when I try to use the _"Long press on..."_ > _"Home"_ option?
Many phones have a default action pre-bound to long pressing the home button (e.g. Google Assistat). This interfere's with **Split Screen Shortcut**.

To properly set up the home button option:

1. Disable the **Assist app**
    * Go to your Android's **Settings** > **Apps & notifications** > **Default apps** > **Assist & voice input** > **Assist app** > choose **None**
1. Enable toggling split-screen mode using your **home button**.
    * Go to **Split Screen Shortcut** > **Long press on...** > enable **Home**
1. Done! Enjoy glitch-free multitasking!
