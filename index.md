# Pro Tips
## Enable split-screen mode for more apps!
Some apps like [Facebook Messenger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.facebook.orca), [LINE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.naver.line.android), and [Google Duo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.tachyon) don't support split-screen mode. To force them to allow split-screen mode:

1. [enable _developer settings_ on the phone](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) if it isn't already.
2. enable the **Settings** > **System** > **Developer options** > **Force activities to be re-sizable** option.
3. restart the phone.
4. done! split-screen mode should work on tons more apps now.

Unfortunately, some apps like [Instagram](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.android) will crash if put into split-screen mode. And other apps like the homescreen, and [Google Assistant](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.googleassistant) still disallow split-screen mode.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why isn't Split screen working on the home screen?
Split screen can only be toggled on when there is an app other than the home screen app opened. (e.g. YouTube)

## Why am I getting _"App does not support split screen"_ message?
See [Enable split-screen mode for more apps](#enable-split-screen-mode-for-more-apps)

## Why is split-screen mode turning on then off right away?
Your phone may already come with the split-screen shortcut. Go into the Split Screen app's settings, and turn off the trigger that's causing this issue. Alternatively, uninstall the Split Screen app.
